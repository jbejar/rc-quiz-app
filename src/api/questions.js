    question: "Does the marijuana initiative allow some people to grow their own marijuana?",
    answerindex : 1,
    explanation_title: "The Marijuana Initiative Will Allow Some People to Grow Their Own Marijuana.",
    explanation: `Holders of medical cannabis cards who live more than 100 miles from a cannabis dispensary
    would be allowed to grow “up to six cannabis plants for personal medical use ….” (Section
    26-60b-201(6)(d).) Nothing in the Initiative allows the State to license or monitor
    homegrown marijuana operations.`,

    question: "Are there limits on consumption?",
    explanation_title: "The Marijuana Initiative Will Allow People Who Grow Their Own Marijuana to Evade Purchase and Use Limits.",
    explanation: `The Marijuana Initiative allows users to purchase up to 2 oz. of
    cannabis (or 10 grams of tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabidiol) from dispensaries every 14
    days.1
     (Section 26-60b-502(3)-(4).) But nothing in the Initiative prevents a person who is
    authorized to grow his own marijuana from consuming more than that from his own homegrown
    plants (which can be very large) or from also buying the maximum amount from a
    dispensary.`,

    question: "Is there clear way for law enforcement to distinguish between legally purchased marijuana and illegal marijuana?",
    explanation_title: "The Marijuana Initiative Will Create Significant Challenges for Law Enforcement.",
    explanation: `Law enforcement will have no way to distinguish between personally-grown legal marijuana
    and illegal marijuana. Additionally, law enforcement will have no way to distinguish
    illegally purchased marijuana from legally purchased marijuana. To be sure, a person who
    has a medical cannabis card who is in possession of cannabis must have “a label that
    identifies that the cannabis or cannabis product was originally sold from a licensed cannabis
    dispensary ….” (Section 26-60b-204.) But we see no reason why a cardholder could not
    keep a label from marijuana bought legally and show it to law enforcement to justify
    possession of illegally purchased marijuana. In any event, the fine for someone who does not
    have the card or label is only $100. (Section 26-60b-204(5).) `,

    question: "Does the initiative allow marijuana to be sold in pharmacies?",
    explanation_title: " The Marijuana Initiative Requires Medical Marijuana to Be Sold Through Marijuana Dispensaries, Not Licensed Pharmacies.",
    explanation: `As far as we can determine, marijuana would be
    the only serious controlled substance in Utah sold for alleged medicinal purposes without a
    prescription and outside of licensed pharmacies. (Section 26-60b-301, 26-60b-502.)`,

    question: "How long will the Department of Health keep records from cannabis production facilities and dispensaries before they are required to be destroyed?",
    explanation_title: "The Marijuana Initiative Requires the State to Destroy Records of Cannabis Sales after 60 Days, which Will Hamper Law Enforcement.",
    explanation: `Because pharmacies distribute controlled
    substances, they are subject to strict record keeping requirements under both federal and state
    law, and all those records must be kept for at least five years. See Utah Admin. Code. §
    R156-37-602. The Marijuana Initiative does not impose these requirements on cannabis
    production establishments or dispensaries. And it requires the Department of Health to
    destroy the records it receives from cannabis production facilities and dispensaries within 60
    days. (Section 26-60b-103.) This will severely hamper the ability of law enforcement to
    investigate and punish violations.`,
